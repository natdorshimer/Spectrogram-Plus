So recently I've been having trouble with minor distortion when moving between time and frequency and domains using short time fourier transforms. That discrepancy obviously isn't there in ordinary FFTs and IFFTs. A large part of this has to do with COLA compliancy in windows. Reconstructed audio quality varies greatly depending on the window/fft/sampling rate used which in the end basically boils down to this: Is it COLA compliant? I have to be much more selective in how I choose my windows than a standard spectrogram. In order for my STFT and ISTFT to meet standards, I have to make sure I select a COLA window. I also have to make sure that I choose a proper window for reconstruction based on how the data was modified. That will be a bit more challenging.Step 1 is clear: choose a COLA window for perfeclty reconstructing an unmodified signalStep 2: approximate the best window after the signal goes through filters.I'll have to read a few papers. There's one that seemed pretty useful about Adaptive Window Size selection. But I'll probably need a bit more, because I need to know the best Window type, the best amount of overlap, AND the window size. Gotta hit the books..See:https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Mathematical_Definition_STFT.html#19930https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/iscola.html#d120e78825http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2016/6172453.pdf
