Goal for today is to not code muchToday's goal is mainly to hit the DSP books to obtain some more formal understanding of DSP ideas I didn't learn in college. Main goals for today are:* Refresh old / rusty DSP knowledge* Become more familiarized with STFT and ISTFT reconstruction  	COLA windows, which window types to use* Filter and DSP techniques specifically involved with short time audio* How do I properly reconstruct signals with ISTFT after they've already gone through  processing? Adaptive window selection? Other methods?While not something for today, I need to start gathering resources for voice specifically.Voice mechanics and how that translates into audio, voice resonances and formants, andalgorithms to calculate formants. More intensive / nonbasic signal processing COULD get tricky. If the signal processingtechniques I use get a little bonkers I might want to consider incorporating MATLAB. I haveused certain Python libraries for relatively advanced DSP but even that was a little roughcompared to how easy and powerful MATLAB can be in this area. At least for now C# isperfectly fine but I'll keep this option open for now.
