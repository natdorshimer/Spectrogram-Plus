I learned a lot yesterday by reading Spectral Audio Signal Processing by Julius O. Smith III. I definitely have a stronger understanding of how reconstruction works. The end result being that when you have an analysis window and an output window, the squared window has to be COLA. This is because when you STFT and then ISTFT, the two windows are multiplied w1[n].*w2[n], so if you use the same window, w^2[n] must be COLA compliant. So if we use a roothann window with step size of windowsize/2, then it's clearly COLA compliant since hann window is cola compliant at windowsize/2. I now also have an easy way to visualize COLA compliancy thanks to a python script I wrote. It automatically tests for compliancy and marks them as valid/invalid windows. Things to consider now:* Predictive determination of windows after processing	Requires learning Linear Predictive Coding * Read more about reconstruction after non linear frequency / modification of STFT.   	* Like read a lot more of S.A.S.S.
