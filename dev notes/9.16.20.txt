A lot of progress has been made. Now that mouse position on the image is accurately mapped to indices on the STFT, we can finally use the selected window for DSP!Some things that need to be worked on:Filter capabilities accessable from the GUI	1. White noise filtering	2. Linear frequency shifting within the window itself	3. Nonlinear frequency shifting, most prominent shifting closer to the windowSome misc features to work on eventually	* Adding a grid scale the user can turn on and off 	* Zooming in tracks mouse position and zooms to that point	* Then once I can get the frequency shifting to move around resonant points and have it sound good we have a valid Prototyping build with every important DSP Feature!	* This is going to be very tricky and I fully expect this to take a while	  Modifying frequency components and then reconstructing it into audio that	  sounds good is... very very difficult. And then it's mostly refinement from there! At that point it's things for the end userLet's get to it
